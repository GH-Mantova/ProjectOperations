# ⚖️ SHARED DOCTRINE — applies to EVERY station, no exceptions

## 1. THE READ-BACK RULE

**Every mutation must be read back and PROVED. An action you did not verify did not happen.**

Not "should be". Not "the command exited 0". You **re-read the thing you changed** and assert it now
holds the value you intended.

This exists because every one of these actually happened:

| What was "done" | What was true |
|---|---|
| `Set-Content` wrote the PR body | It wrote a **BOM**, and node refused to parse the file |
| `git commit` succeeded | `$ErrorActionPreference="Stop"` had aborted the script **before** the commit — the log looked clean |
| The merge queue filtered the NEVER-list | PS collapsed the JSON array to **one object**; the filter was a **silent no-op** and it selected **#552, the production-data PR** |
| The PR body carried the gate marker | `$string + $array` joined with **spaces**; the marker was no longer at column 0 |
| "Watcher is down, queue frozen" | It had run **6 minutes ago**; the check used Linux `ps` against a **Windows** process, and compared UTC to local time |

**Therefore: do not hand-roll board operations.** Dot-source the library and use its primitives —
every one of them already reads back:

```powershell
. C:\ProjectOperations2\scripts\pipeline\pipeline-lib.ps1
```

`Get-Board` · `Get-PrBody` · `Get-ChecksFor` · `Set-PrBody` · `Invoke-GitPush` · `Copy-FileFromRef`
`Assert-Mergeable` · `Assert-SmokeGreen` · `Assert-BodyClaimsAreReal` · `Assert-SmokedOrEscalate`
`Merge-Pr` · `Assert-ArtifactSurvived` · `Test-WatcherRepoClean`

If you catch yourself writing `gh pr merge` or `Set-Content` against a PR body directly — **stop.**
The primitive exists precisely because the obvious way is the broken way.

## 2. EVIDENCE, NOT ASSERTION

You are **never** the judge of whether your own work passed.

- **Smoke:** run `scripts\pipeline\smoke-pr.ps1 -Branch <b>`. It boots the API + web against a
  seeded DB and drives the real acceptance suite in a real browser. **The exit code decides.**
  You report the exit code. You do not report your impression of the exit code.
- **CI:** `Assert-SmokeGreen` reads the state **from GitHub**. Pending is not pass. A missing
  required check is not a pass.
- **Your own claims:** `Assert-BodyClaimsAreReal` greps the diff for the artifact you say you built.

> A failure is a **diagnosis**, not a nuisance. **Never re-run hoping for green.** #544's e2e
> "flake" was two tests asserting the exact bug the PR existed to remove — *the tests encoded the
> bug*. If you cannot name the cause, you have not found it.

## 3. NEVER DIAGNOSE FROM SILENCE OR FROM THE DIFF

- **CI:** read the job log — `gh run view <run-id> --job <job-id> --log`. Never reason a CI failure
  out of the diff. Three confidently-wrong diagnoses in one week came from exactly that.
- **Liveness:** "I cannot verify it" is **not** "it is down". The only sanctioned liveness check is
  `scripts\restart-watcher-if-wedged.ps1`. Logs are **UTC**; the machine is **Brisbane (UTC+10)**.
- **Silence is not death.** An agent mid-diagnosis is network-bound and process-invisible. Two
  productive runs were killed as "wedged" (LL-25). Kill on a missed heartbeat or a timeout — never
  on quiet.

## 4. STAY IN YOUR STATION

The supervisor **dispatches**; it does not do the work. A supervisor once ran `git merge` inside the
watcher's repo, hit a conflict, **abandoned it mid-merge**, and reported "STATUS: NOMINAL". That
single act killed the entire overnight queue (LL-38).

**If the job belongs to another station, hand it over. Doing it yourself is the incident.**

Never `git checkout` / `commit` / `push` in `C:\po-watcher\ProjectOperations` — a live agent may be
working there. Conflict work happens in a **disposable worktree**, never a shared tree.

## 5. 🚫 HARD STOPS — escalate to Marco, do not reason your way past them

1. **Azure / Entra / SharePoint — NEVER, not once, not read-modify-write.** No portal, no app
   settings, no secrets, no permissions, no `az`, no `Connect-MgGraph` that writes. These are shared
   company systems; a wrong move locks real staff out of real documents. Write the code, write the
   runbook, ship the PR, **then hand Marco the steps.**
2. **Production data.** #552 writes prod rows. Marco reviews the SQL.
3. **A real human identity.** #538 needs a real Microsoft account on a real shared PC. **No agent
   has an identity.** Get it green and mergeable, then stop.
4. **Anything irreversible** — force-push, branch deletion, destructive migration, deleting a secret.
   *A verification step that gates an irreversible action must COMPLETE BEFORE IT — never alongside
   it.* An agent once walked Marco through deleting a live production secret and testing it in the
   same breath. Only luck prevented an outage (LL-36).
5. **Design or product questions.** Only Marco knows his intent. Never guess it.
6. **Verification exhausted** — two honest attempts failed. **Say so plainly. Do not loop.**

Escalating is not failure. **Escalating something in this list is doing your job correctly.**

## 6. NEVER EXIT SILENTLY

There is no human in a headless run. **10 runs died waiting for an answer to a question nobody was
there to read.**

- Never ask a question. Decide, or escalate in writing and exit.
- If you do nothing, say `NO-OP: <reason>` — loudly. A silent success is indistinguishable from a
  crash, and the watcher will file it as a win.
- Echo progress between phases. Long silences get you killed (see §3).
