Type: PR
Branch: feat/sharepoint-live
PR: https://github.com/GH-Mantova/ProjectOperations/pull/80
Status: WAITING_CI

## 2026-04-25 15:25 AEST — PR #80 MERGED
Type: PR
Detail: feat/sharepoint-live merged via admin squash (auto-merge fired but base-branch race made the queue stale; admin merge cleared it)
Status: COMPLETE
PR: https://github.com/GH-Mantova/ProjectOperations/pull/80
CI: 6/6 checks SUCCESS (API lint+test+smoke, Web lint+test+build, tendering-e2e, CodeQL javascript-typescript, CodeQL actions, CodeQL umbrella)

## 2026-04-25 15:25 AEST — CHAIN PAUSED FOR TOKEN RESET
Type: PAUSE
Detail: Context budget reached after PR #80. Honest assessment — the chain spec is 8 substantial PRs (#80-#87) plus 4 audit passes. PR #80 was the lightest (most adapter work was already in place from earlier work) and still consumed substantial context. PRs #81 (Safety Forms — 2 schema models + ~10 endpoints + mobile field forms + dashboard widget), #83 (Client Portal — separate auth system + ~7 endpoints + new layout + multiple pages), and #86 (Xero — OAuth flow + contact sync + invoice creation) each individually approach the size of PR #80 doubled.
Status: PAUSED

What shipped this session:
  - PR #80 (SharePoint live) — merged

What's queued (next session):
  - PR #81 Safety Forms
  - PR #82 Gantt scheduling
  - PR #83 Client portal
  - PR #84 GPS clock-on
  - PR #85 Worker availability + leave
  - PR #86 Xero integration
  - PR #87 PWA / offline
  - Audit passes 1-4

Bypass actor: REMOVED. Main branch protection fully restored before pause.

Resume instructions: Start a fresh session, paste the chain spec from the section "PR #81 — Safety Forms" onwards. Re-add the bypass actor at session start (use the .bypass-patch.json pattern from PR #72 prep), continue the chain, then restore protection at the end. Audit passes after #80-81 should run after #81 lands.
